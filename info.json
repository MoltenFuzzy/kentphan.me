I am currently looking for opportunies in the tech industry. \n\n I am a full stack developer with experience in C++, C#, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I am also familiar with React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostrgreSQL, and AWS. I am a quick learner and I am always looking to learn new things.",

			"reflection": "Mainly a side project to learn modern web frameworks such as NextJS using the T3 stack for type safety on both the client and server. It actually started off as Kentan, whiched used a similar type safe stack consisting of Nextjs for the frontend and GraphQL in the backend. Felt as thought GraphQl, specifically TypeGraphQL had too much boilerplate and didn't allow me to build things quickly. Kennekt was a full rewrite of Kentan and a huge improvement on code quality based on what I learned from Kentan. Some other things I learned was how to use AWS S3 to store user images in an s3 bucket, implemented basic authentication, security, and learned SQL for my postgres database. Lots of learning! ðŸ˜…",

I also learned how to use MongoDB to store user data and Express.js to build a REST API for our backend. I took part in writing parts of the frontend as well as many of the API endpoints. I also learned how to use GitHub to collaborate with my team members. Overall, I learned a lot from this project and I am proud of what we accomplished. Really grateful to Gabby for leading our team.",

I also learned how to use React because I thought the frontend was a buggy mess so I decided to rewrite the frontend 3 days before the deadline. This was my quarter long project for my CS180(Software Engineering) class and I enjoyed learning about software development techniques with a touch of design patterns.",
